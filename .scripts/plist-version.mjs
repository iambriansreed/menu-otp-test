/**
 * @file Reads and writes `CFBundleShortVersionString` in an Info.plist.
 *
 * This is the one place that knows how to edit that key, because it is needed from two
 * directions: `.scripts/release.config.json` hands it to commit-and-tag-version as an
 * "updater" during a release, and `.scripts/version.mjs` calls it when a version is set
 * by hand. Keeping it here means the substitution is written once and the two paths
 * cannot drift apart.
 *
 * It is a text substitution rather than a plist parser (or PlistBuddy, which rewrites
 * the whole file with its own indentation), so a version bump stays a one-line diff.
 *
 * As a command:
 * ```sh
 * .scripts/plist-version.mjs app/Resources/Info.plist          # print the version
 * .scripts/plist-version.mjs app/Resources/Info.plist 0.2.0    # set it
 * ```
 *
 * @module plist-version

 * opening `<string>`, the version itself, and the closing `</string>`. The value is
 * matched as "anything but `<`" so a malformed file can never swallow the rest of it.
 *
 * Global, so `writeVersion` sees every occurrence and can refuse a plist with more
 * than one; without the flag `replace` stops after the first and the duplicate-key
 * check below could never fail. Both users below are stateless despite the `lastIndex`
 * a global regex carries: `matchAll` works on a clone of it, and `replace` resets it.
