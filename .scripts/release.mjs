/**
 * @file Cuts a release from the Conventional Commits since the last tag.
 *
 * Wraps commit-and-tag-version (the tool Skrapa uses) so that there is one definition of
 * what a release is, shared by CI and by a release cut from a laptop. It works out the
 * bump, writes it to every version file (see `.scripts/release.config.json`), adds the
 * section to `CHANGELOG.md`, commits `chore(release): x.y.z` and tags `v<x.y.z>`.
 *
 * It commits and tags **locally and never pushes**. CI runs this same script on every
 * push to `main` (`.github/workflows/release.yml`); one cut by hand is published once
 * pushed with `git push --follow-tags origin main`.
 *
 * ```sh
 * .scripts/release.mjs                      # cut a release, if the commits call for one
 * .scripts/release.mjs --dry-run            # show what it would do
 * .scripts/release.mjs --release-as 1.0.0   # choose the version (any tool flag passes through)
 * .scripts/release.mjs --notes 0.2.0        # print that version's CHANGELOG.md section
 * ```
 *
 * Below 1.0.0 a breaking change bumps the minor version and a feat or fix the patch,
 * which is commit-and-tag-version's `preMajor` behaviour.
 *
 * @module release
